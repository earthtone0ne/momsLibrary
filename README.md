A simple app with an intended audience of one: Mom.  

A voracious consumer of books and movies with a Swiss-cheese memory, dear Mom has been tracking her reading/viewing history in a Word doc, which she dutifully updates and periodically prints.  The 40+ pages go into a binder to carry along when she visits her local library, so she never ends up with the same book twice.

What if she didn't need to print and carry all that data?
